# Bartenders Work Schedule

#### Created by:

Project Description
-
In this project, we worked on several features:
An optimization system that solves the work scheduling problem by using all the algorithms we learned, and finds the best weekly arrangement that takes into account all the hard and soft constraints of the bar company.

#### The algorithms we implemented are:
- Hill climbing (with random restart)
- simulated annealing
- Genetic algorithm


The problem of managing the work arrangement of bartenders is a subproblem of the shift arrangement problem which is a well-known optimization problem defined as a np-hard problem.
The problem is to determining a personal work arrangement for each bartender (each bartender has different days and hours that are convenient for him, and especially different requests), and our optimization system would like to find a legal solution (a solution that meets all the hard constraints) that will meets all these constraints.


The different screens
-
The main screen has a graphic display which runs all the algorithms we learned, and finally we presente the the best weekly arrangement that takes into account all the hard and soft constraints of the bar company, that represents the best solution.

### Running

To run, open PyCharm, then open your terminal and run the project with "py selectionControlClass.py" command. Then open your browser with "http://localhost:80/" domain and enjoy :)


## Future improvements

As we continue to work on this app, we encourage anyone that wants to help out to do so!
Just open the project in Visual Studio Code and add your own touches!
Other than that, we would appreciate if you would try to stick to our design language and patterns.
Have fun with this project and don't forget to create a pull request once you're done so this project could have a little bit of YOU in it!
